# JLDishwasher App

## Requirements
* Xcode 7.3.1

## Project Setup
* Setting min SDK to 9.0 for the sake of the exercise.
* Using Carthage as a dependency management tool. I prefer it for building dependencies only once. In real world scenario it may be better to check in sources of dependencies, but I don't for the sake of the exercise.
